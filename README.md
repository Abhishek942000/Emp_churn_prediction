# Emp_churn_prediction
An employee churn prediction project uses machine learning to identify which employees are likely to leave an organization. By analyzing historical employee data—such as age, tenure, job role, satisfaction scores, and performance metrics—the model learns patterns that indicate higher turnover risk. Key steps in the project include data preprocessing, feature engineering, and training a model using algorithms like logistic regression, random forest, or XGBoost. The model's accuracy is evaluated with metrics like precision and recall. Insights from the project help HR teams develop targeted strategies to retain talent, reduce hiring costs, and boost employee satisfaction.
